# SLA Violation Profiler

## Overview

The SLA-Violation-Profiler extension derives auditable evidence of Service
Level Agreement (SLA) compliance from findings that already exist in the ODG
delivery database. For a configured OCM root component, it evaluates whether
findings were resolved or rescored within the processing time
that the SLA permits, and persists the outcome as `sla_violation` records
that can be queried for reporting and audits.

## Motivation

Compliance obligations require software teams to demonstrate that findings
were handled within agreed timeframes. Reconstructing this evidence manually
for a past audit period is expensive: findings, rescorings and release dates
must be correlated across many component versions. The SLA-Violation-Profiler
automates this correlation and produces a persistent, per-release verdict
that can be replayed later without recomputing the underlying history.

## Scope

- **Input**: an OCM root component and either a specific version or a time
  range of versions to evaluate.
- **Finding types evaluated**: all finding types available in the ODG data model.
- **Output**: one `sla_violation` `ArtefactMetadata` record per evaluated root
  component version, containing the list of individual policy violations that
  remained open at that version's release date.
- **Persistence**: results are written back to the database through
  the ODG Core API.

## How It Works

The profiler follows a two-step approach: recognise policy violations per
component version, then materialise them as a single SLA record for the
release.

### 1. Resolve versions to evaluate

For each configured component, the profiler determines the set of versions to
scan:

- If a fixed `version` is configured, that version is used directly.
- Otherwise, the ODG Core API is queried for the most recent component
  versions within the configured `time_range`, bounded by
  `max_versions_limit`.

Versions for which an `sla_violation` record already exists in the delivery
database are skipped. This makes the extension safe to re-run: prior audits
remain stable, and only new releases will be evaluated.

### 2. Collect findings and rescorings for the release

For each version, the profiler resolves the OCM root descriptor and traverses
the component graph to collect the identities of all
transitively referenced components. It then queries the ODG Core API for:

- all finding records attached to any of these components; and
- all `rescoring` records that reference those findings.

The version's **release date** is taken from the root component's creation
date. All timestamps are normalised before comparison.

### 3. Determine the effective deadline per finding

For each finding, an initial deadline is computed from its discovery date and
its `allowed_processing_time`:

```
deadline = discovery_date + allowed_processing_time
```

Findings without an `allowed_processing_time` are ignored, since no SLA
applies. Findings whose `meta.creation_date` is later than the release date
are also ignored, because they did not yet exist at the moment of release.

Rescorings created after the release date are discarded, as they represent
knowledge the release could not have had. The remaining rescorings are sorted
by creation date and applied in order. Each rescoring can shift the effective
deadline in one of three ways:

- an explicit `due_date` on the rescoring becomes the new deadline;
- an updated `allowed_processing_time` is added to the original discovery
  date to produce a new deadline; or
- if neither is set, the deadline is cleared and no SLA applies from that
  point on.

### 4. Detect policy violations

Two conditions produce a `SlaViolation` for a finding:

1. A rescoring was created **after** the current deadline had already
   passed — the SLA was breached before the finding was reassessed.
2. Once all rescorings have been applied, the final deadline still lies
   **before** the release date — the finding shipped in the release with an
   overdue SLA.

Each violation captures the type-specific identifying attributes of the
underlying finding, the `referenced_type`, and the `ComponentArtefactId` the
finding was attached to.

### 5. Persist one SLA record per release

All violations detected for a given root version are aggregated into a single
`ArtefactMetadata` entry:

- `meta.datasource`: `sla-violation-profiler`
- `meta.type`: `sla_violation`
- `artefact`: the root component's `ComponentArtefactId`
- `data`: an `SlaViolations` object containing the list of `SlaViolation`
  entries; an empty list indicates a compliant release.

The records are pushed to the ODG Core API in a single `update_metadata`
call at the end of the run.

## Data Model

The extension produces records of type `sla_violation` and datasource
`sla-violation-profiler`. The `data` payload has the following shape:

- `SlaViolations`
  - `sla_violations`: list of
    - `SlaViolation`
      - `finding`: the type-specific identifying fields of the underlying finding
      - `referenced_type`: the datatype of the underlying finding
        (e.g. any `finding/*` datatype supported by the ODG data model)
      - `artefact`: the `ComponentArtefactId` the finding was attached to

See {doc}`/contents/concepts/01-data-model` for the surrounding
`ArtefactMetadata` model.

## Idempotency and Re-runs

The extension is designed to run as a scheduled job. Because existing
`sla_violation` records for a `(component_name, component_version)` pair
suppress re-evaluation, re-runs process only those versions that have not yet
been profiled. To re-evaluate a version after its underlying data has changed,
the existing `sla_violation` record must first be removed from the delivery
database.
