# Issue Replicator

The Issue Replicator extension manages the GitHub issue lifecycle for findings. It creates, updates, and closes GitHub issues to track security and compliance findings discovered by other ODG extensions.

## Configuration Example

```yaml
issue_replicator:
  delivery_dashboard_url: https://delivery-dashboard.example.com
  interval: 3600                     # 1 hour
  mappings:
    - prefix: 'acme.org/product-a'
      github_repository: github.com/acme/product-a-issues
      github_issue_labels_to_preserve: ["do-not-remove-.*", "priority-.*"]
      number_included_closed_issues: 100
      milestones:
        title:
          prefix: "sprint-"
          sprint:
            value_type: name
    - prefix: ''                     # catch-all for all other components
      github_repository: github.com/acme/security-findings
      github_issue_labels_to_preserve: []
      number_included_closed_issues: 50
```

## Top-Level Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `delivery_dashboard_url` | string | — | Publicly accessible URL to the delivery dashboard (included in GitHub issues). |
| `interval` | int (seconds) | `3600` | Maximum time before GitHub issues are updated. |
| `mappings` | list | `[]` | Per-prefix component mappings. See mapping fields below. |

## Mapping Fields

Each entry in the `mappings` list supports the following fields:

| Option | Type | Required | Description |
|--------|------|----------|-------------|
| `prefix` | string | yes | Component name prefix. Use `''` (empty string) to match all components. |
| `github_repository` | string | yes | GitHub repository where issues should be created (e.g., `github.com/org/repo`). |
| `github_issue_labels_to_preserve` | list | `[]` | Regex patterns for labels that should not be removed on issue updates. |
| `number_included_closed_issues` | int | `100` | Number of closed issues to consider when deciding whether to create or reopen. Use `-1` for unlimited. |
| `milestones` | object | — | Configuration for mapping ODG sprints to GitHub milestones. |

## Milestone Configuration

The `milestones` object configures how ODG sprints are mapped to GitHub milestones:

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `milestones.title.prefix` | string | Prefix for GitHub milestone names (e.g., `"sprint-"`). |
| `milestones.title.sprint.value_type` | string | How to format the sprint: `name` (use sprint name) or `date` (use sprint date). |

## Configuration Details

### `interval`

The time (in seconds) between regular GitHub issue updates. Default is 3600 seconds (1 hour).

**Note:** Issues are also updated immediately in response to certain events:
- Initial scan completion
- Rescoring actions
- Finding status changes

This interval ensures issues are kept synchronized even without these triggering events.

### `mappings`

Allows routing findings from different components to different GitHub repositories
and applying different issue management policies.

#### Prefix Matching

The `prefix` field uses simple string prefix matching (not regex):
- `prefix: 'acme.org'` matches `acme.org/product` and `acme.org/another-product`
- `prefix: ''` (empty string) matches all components (use as a catch-all)

Multiple mappings are evaluated in order, and the first matching prefix is used.

#### GitHub Repository

Specifies the target GitHub repository for issue creation. Format: `github.com/org-name/repo-name`

**Example:**
```yaml
github_repository: github.com/my-org/security-findings
```

#### Preserved Labels

The `github_issue_labels_to_preserve` field contains regex patterns for labels that
should not be removed when ODG updates an issue. This is useful for:
- Manual labels added by team members
- Integration labels from other tools
- Priority or severity overrides

**Example:**
```yaml
github_issue_labels_to_preserve:
  - "do-not-remove-.*"
  - "priority-.*"
  - "team-assignment"
```

#### Closed Issue History

The `number_included_closed_issues` setting controls how far back the extension
looks when deciding whether to create a new issue or reopen an existing closed one.

- **Lower values** (e.g., `50`): Faster API operations, but may create duplicate issues if the original was closed long ago
- **Higher values** (e.g., `200`): Better deduplication, but more GitHub API requests
- **`-1`**: No limit (search all closed issues)

**Recommended:** Start with `100` and adjust based on your repository's issue volume.
