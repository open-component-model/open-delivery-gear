# Static Application Security Testing Attestor

The Static Application Security Testing Attestor extension checks whether static analysis scans have been executed for components and creates findings when scans are missing or outdated.

## Configuration Example

```yaml
sast:
  interval: 86400                    # 24 hours
  on_unsupported: warning
```

## Top-Level Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `interval` | int (seconds) | `86400` | Maximum time before a component is re-checked. |
| `on_unsupported` | string | `warning` | Behavior when artefact kind/type/access is unsupported. Options: `fail`, `ignore`, `warning`. |

## Configuration Details

### `interval`

The maximum time (in seconds) before a component is re-checked for SAST
scan execution. Default is 86400 seconds (24 hours).

This interval ensures:
- Components are regularly verified for SAST coverage
- New components are identified quickly if they lack scans
- Scan execution tracking remains current

### `on_unsupported`

Defines the behavior when an artefact kind, type, or access method is not supported:

- **`fail`**: Raise an exception and stop processing
- **`ignore`**: Silently skip the unsupported artefact
- **`warning`** (default): Skip the artefact and log a warning message
